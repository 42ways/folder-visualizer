# folder-visualizer

This Python Script creates a PlantUML input file to visualise a directory tree.

The elements used are not configurable yet. Folders are represented by the folder element, connected by default lines (see https://plantuml.com/deployment-diagram).

Optional infomation like number or size of files in the folder can be included by using command line options of the script.

`folder-visualizer -h` prints explanatory text for all options.
